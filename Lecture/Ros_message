By convention, all .msg files are stored in a directory within your package called "msg," and you can build all of them by editing the CMakeLists.txt file and the catkin/package.xml file.
0)-inside the PackageName create a folder called "msg"
  - inside the msg Folder create a messageName file with extension .msg . That msg file will contain the message for the that Package

1)Open package.xml, and make sure these two lines are in it:

  <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
  <run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend>

2)Open CMakeLists.txt in your favorite text editor (rosed from the previous tutorial is a good option).

Add the message_generation dependency to the find package call which already exists in your CMakeLists.txt so that you can generate messages. You can do this by simply adding message_generation to the list of COMPONENTS such that it looks like this:

# Do not just add this line to your CMakeLists.txt, modify the existing line

     find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp rospy std_msgs message_generation)

3)Also make sure you export the message runtime dependency.
  catkin_package(
  ...
  CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
  ...)

4)Find the following block of code:
# add_message_files(
#   FILES
#   Message1.msg
#   Message2.msg
# )

Uncomment it by removing the # symbols and then replace the stand in Message*.msg files with your .msg file, such that it looks like this:

5)Find the following block of code:
# generate_messages(
#    DEPENDENCIES
#    std_msgs  # Or other packages containing msgs
# )

Uncomment it by removing the # symbols and then replace std_msgs with the messages your messages depend on, such that it looks like this:

NB: rosmsg prints out message definition information and can find source files that use a message type.
  rosmsg show [message type]
